# Brush-Converter
Those script can unpack material image file and params from brushes of different software, including .abr(photoshop), .brushset(procreate), .sut(clip studio paint). However it can not pack back yet. Because we still now the rule of new version abr totally, and can not solve digital assets of .layer file in .sut brush. I'm looking for ways.
